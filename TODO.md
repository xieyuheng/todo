- how to view type is ideal of domain

# lattice-lisp.js

fail faster -- try the simple but maybe wrong solution first

(1) finite structural type
(2) recursive structural type
(2) recursive structural type + polymorphism

- use lattice-lisp as the denotational semantics of lattice-lisp, specially for type system
  - maybe use explicit substitution for runtime semantics
- use the idea of combinators -- by putting env and ctx to the last currying argument position.
- use the idea of propagator model to implement type system.
- implement `not` as type operator, which is needed to view pattern in pattern matching as type.

luca cardelli's work is very close to my research interests in lattice-lisp.
