## combinatory-logic

> combinatory logic and dependent type theory

using combinatory logic as the domain of language with dependent type:
- a type (set) is a predicate-like element
- only need one judgement `|-`
- all bound variable can be compiled out: lambda, pi, sigma
- infinite sum and product can be handled by high order functions:
  - first argument is a type, second argument is a function

> dependent type and combinatory logic

maybe dependent type is more easy to develop in combinatory logic.

> the S of combinatory logic is much like the dup of interaction nets
