xieyuheng/x-lisp.js -- recursive structural type

- use x-lisp as the denotational semantics of x-lisp, specially for type system
  - maybe use explicit substitution for runtime semantics
- use the idea of combinators -- by putting env and ctx to the last currying argument position.
- use the idea of propagator model to implement type system.
- implement not as type operator, which is needed to view pattern in pattern matching as type.

luca cardelli's work is very close to my research interests in x-lisp.
