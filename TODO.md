xieyuheng/x-lisp.js -- recursive structural type

- use x-lisp as the denotational semantics of x-lisp, specially for type system
  - maybe use explicit substitution for runtime semantics

- equal of recursive defined function mod partial evaluation
- use the idea of combinators -- by putting env and ctx to the last currying argument position.
- use the idea of propagator model to implement type system.
- implement not as type operator, which is needed to view pattern in pattern matching as type.

> combinatory logic and dependent type theory

using combinatory logic as the domain of language with dependent type:
- a type (set) is a predicate-like element
- only need one judgement `|-`
- all bound variable can be compiled out: lambda, pi, sigma
- infinite sum and product can be handled by high order functions:
  - first argument is a type, second argument is a function

> dependent type and combinatory logic

maybe dependent type is more easy to develop in combinatory logic.

> the S of combinatory logic is much like the dup of interaction nets

## foundation of mathematics

learn from hilbert

- my understanding of the logic of mathematics is shaped by type theory now,
  maybe i should learn the other way.

## recursion theory
